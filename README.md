# RISC-V-Edge-AI-with-VSDSquadron-Pro

# Course Project

## Overview
This repository documents my progress through the **RISC-V Edge AI with VSDSquadron PRO** course by **VLSI System Design (VSD)**.  
The course is centered on implementing **machine learning (ML) and neural networks** on a highly resource-limited platform â€” the **SiFive FE310-G002 RISC-V SoC** with only **16 KB RAM**.  

Since I did not have access to the physical board, the entire workflow (training, quantization, inference, and image capture) was simulated using **Freedom Studio** for RISC-V bare-metal builds.

The core of this project is an **MNIST handwritten digit classifier**, trained and quantized in Python, and ported into a simulated bare-metal RISC-V environment for inference.

## Note
All the code in this repository was developed as part of a workshop.  
I currently do not have access to the required hardware board, so the programs have not been tested on the actual hardware.  
However, each project has been built successfully with **zero errors and zero warnings** in the development environment.

---

##  Objectives
- Train and quantize a neural network for **MNIST digit recognition**.  
- Optimize the model to fit **memory-constrained environments** (â‰¤16 KB).  
- Simulate deployment on **SiFive FE310-G002** without requiring hardware.  
- Explore bare-metal programming concepts and memory-aware inference.  

---

##  Course Modules (Highlights)
The course spans **27 learning modules**, progressing from basic ML to quantized NN deployment:

1. Edge AI introduction & VSDSquadron board overview  
2. ML basics â€“ regression, gradient descent, visualization  
3. Classification â€“ KNN, SVM, and embedded inference  
4. MNIST with SVM and RISC-V simulation  
5. Quantization & fitting AI into 16 KB RAM  
6. Neural networks â€“ from scratch to 98% accuracy  
7. Bit-quantized NN deployment on RISC-V
